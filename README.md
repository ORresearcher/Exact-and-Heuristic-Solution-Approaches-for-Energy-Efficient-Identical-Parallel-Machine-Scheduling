# Exact-and-Heuristic-Solution-Approaches-for-Energy-Efficient-Identical-Parallel-Machine-Scheduling

The folder "instances" contains all the data for the instances used in the experimental evaluation.<br><br>
The folder "results" contains the results obtained by the solution approaches considered in the paper, that is the <i>Exact algorithm with Formulation 2 (F2)</i>, <i>Enhanced Heuristic Solver (EHS)</i>, the <i>Exact algorithm with initialization provided by Formulation 2 (F2-init)</i>, the <i>Exact algorithm with Formulation 2 (F2)</i>, the <i>Exact algorithm with Formulation 1 (F1)</i>, and <i>Split-greedy Scheduler with Exchange Search (SGS-ES)</i>.
F2-init, EHS and SGS-ES were run 10 times owing to the presence of at least one stochastic component in the algorithms. The corresponding results are organized in 10 different folders, numbered from 1 to 10.
